# Credential-to-Opportunity Implementation Checklist

> **Source spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-credential-opportunity-roadmap.md`](../specs/2026-04-18-credential-opportunity-roadmap.md)
>
> **For implementers:** Use checkbox updates in this file as the single progress tracker. Work top-to-bottom. Keep the app buildable after each task boundary.

**Goal:** Upgrade Stellaroid Earn from a credential registry + payment demo into a trusted issuer, recruiter-readable proof, and escrowed paid opportunity product.

**Current base:** The repo already has a live contract, Freighter-powered frontend, proof page, and register/verify/pay flow. This checklist extends that base instead of replacing it.

## Recommended Execution Order

1. Phase 1 trust layer
2. Phase 2 shared types and bindings
3. Phase 3 proof page upgrade
4. Phase 4 opportunity contract
5. Phase 5 routes
6. Phase 6 component split
7. Phase 7 cleanup and verification

---

## Hackathon Cut Line

If time runs short, stop after these:

- [x] issuer registry on-chain
- [x] role-based verification
- [x] credential revocation/suspension
- [x] rich proof page
- [x] opportunity create/fund/release flow

That is the minimum strong demo set.
