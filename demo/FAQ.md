# FAQ — for judges, sponsors, and pilot partners

## Product

**Q: What does "proof-of-work" mean here? Mining?**
No. We mean *evidence that a unit of work was completed, verified, and paid for.* Zero compute, zero mining. Just a SHA-256 hash anchored on Stellar.

**Q: Does the deliverable file leave the user's machine?**
No. Hashing is done client-side in the browser via Web Crypto API. Only the hash touches the network.

**Q: What happens if a user loses the original file?**
The hash remains on-chain forever, but the hash alone cannot reconstruct the file. Users must keep their own copies. Stellaroid Earn is a proof registry, not storage.

**Q: Can the same hash be registered twice?**
No. The contract rejects duplicates — `AlreadyExists` is surfaced as a human-readable toast.

**Q: Can a proof be revoked?**
Not in the current MVP. Adding revocation is a v2 scope decision (VeracityLink-style `revoke` with historical preservation).

## Business

**Q: What's the revenue model?**
Today: none. Future: small platform fee on the pay step (opt-in), SaaS tier for organizations that want white-labeled Proof Blocks, or stablecoin rails with spread.

**Q: Who pays the transaction fees?**
The signing wallet. Stellar fees are sub-cent, so it's a non-issue for demos and realistic use.

**Q: Why Stellar and not Ethereum or Solana?**
Sub-cent fees + 5-second finality + Freighter's smooth onboarding + native payment primitives (no wrapped assets). Ethereum fees kill micro-payments. Solana has better fees but Freighter's UX + Soroban's Rust DX won for this vertical.

## Technical

**Q: What's on-chain vs. off-chain?**
On-chain: SHA-256 hash, issuer address, student address, amount, status flags, timestamps. Off-chain: the deliverable file itself (user-held).

**Q: What's the stack?**
Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19, `@stellar/stellar-sdk`, `@stellar/freighter-api`, Rust + Soroban SDK for the contract. No Tailwind, no component library — pure CSS modules + design tokens.

**Q: Is it mainnet-ready?**
No. Testnet-only for the MVP. Mainnet readiness is a dedicated work item: contract audit, gas/fee review, error budget, rate limits on the RPC.

**Q: What happens when Soroban RPC goes down?**
The health pill turns red within 60 seconds. `withTimeout` (15s) prevents UI hangs. Humanized error messages ship to the user — never raw ScVal or HostError.

**Q: Accessibility?**
WCAG AA contrast on all tokens. `:focus-visible` rings everywhere. `prefers-reduced-motion` respected globally. 44×44 minimum touch targets. Inline SVG icons (no emoji).

## Security

**Q: What stops someone from anchoring a fake hash?**
Nothing at the cryptographic layer — the contract just stores what's submitted. Trust in *who* issued comes from the issuer's address. This is a **provable audit trail**, not a KYC system. Pair with DID / verifiable credentials for strong identity.

**Q: What if Freighter is phished?**
Same answer as any wallet app. We never touch seed phrases. We only request signatures on scoped transactions. Users approve each action explicitly.

**Q: Error handling?**
All contract errors flow through `humanizeError()` — 10 mapping rules covering user-rejected, network mismatch, timeout, simulation failed, unauthorized, duplicate, invalid, not-found, fetch-failed, insufficient-balance, and a safe fallback. Raw errors never reach JSX.

## Roadmap

**v1 (today):** register → verify → pay → share, testnet.
**v1.1:** demo-mode fallback when RPC is cold, verified-events history feed.
**v2:** mainnet, USDC-on-Stellar payment option, revocation, multi-signer issuers.
**v3:** org dashboards, API for external verification, embeddable Proof Block widget.
